# ghs-backlog-fix

Applies backlog item fixes using parallel worktree-based agents -- clones the repo once, creates worktrees for each fix, launches agents simultaneously, verifies acceptance criteria, and creates PRs.

## What It Does

`ghs-backlog-fix` is the most complex skill in GHS. It reads structured project items from GitHub Projects (via `gh project item-list` and jq queries), classifies each into a category, and spawns parallel agents to fix them.

### Item Categories

| Category | Description | Worktree? | Example |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **A** | API-only fixes (no file changes) | No | Setting repo description, enabling settings |
| **B** | File changes (each gets a worktree) | Yes | Adding LICENSE, creating .editorconfig |
| **CI** | CI diagnosis and fix | Yes | Fixing failing CI workflows |

### Two Modes

- **Single item** — provide a project item identifier; GHS shows a focused plan and fixes just that item
- **Batch** — provide a repo identifier; GHS queries all FAIL project items, shows a batch plan table, and fixes them all in parallel after confirmation

### Process

1. Discover and classify all FAIL items
2. Clone or pull the repository
3. Show the batch plan and wait for user confirmation
4. Create worktrees for Category B and CI items
5. Launch all agents in parallel (one Task tool call)
6. Collect results, retry transient failures once
7. Update project items and `[GHS Score]` item with new scores via `gh project item-edit`
8. Clean up worktrees (except NEEDS_HUMAN items)
9. Display final results report

## Example

```
## Batch Plan: phmatray/my-project

| # | Item              | Tier | Pts | Category  | Branch           |
|---|-------------------|------|-----|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | LICENSE           | T1   | 4   | B (file)  | fix/license      |
| 2 | Branch Protection | T1   | 4   | A (API)   | --               |
| 3 | .editorconfig     | T2   | 2   | B (file)  | fix/editorconfig |
| 4 | CI Workflow Health | T2   | 2   | CI        | fix/ci-health    |

Total items: 4 (1 API-only, 2 file changes, 1 CI)
Points recoverable: 12

Proceed with all? (y/n/select)
```

After completion:

```
## Results: phmatray/my-project

| Item              | Tier | Pts | Status   | PR  |
|-------------------|------|-----|----------|-----|
| LICENSE           | T1   | 4   | [PASS]   | #12 |
| Branch Protection | T1   | 4   | [PASS]   | -- (API) |
| .editorconfig     | T2   | 2   | [PASS]   | #13 |
| CI Workflow Health | T2   | 2   | [FAILED] | --  |

---

Summary:
  Applied: 3/4
  PRs created: 2
  Points recovered: 10/12
  New health score: 73% (was 45%)

Remaining items:
  [FAILED] CI Workflow Health — build.yml requires manual investigation
```

## Routes To

After fixing, GHS suggests:

- **[ghs-merge-prs](/skills/ghs-merge-prs)** — to merge the created PRs
- **[ghs-backlog-board](/skills/ghs-backlog-board)** — to see the updated dashboard
- **[ghs-repo-scan](/skills/ghs-repo-scan)** — to re-scan and verify all fixes

## Technical Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Allowed tools | `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(git:*)`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task` |
| Spawns sub-agents | Yes — Category A agent, Category B agents (one per item), Category CI agent |
| Phases | 8 (Discover, Prepare Repo, Show Plan, Create Worktrees, Launch Agents, Collect Results, Cleanup, Report) |
| Requires | `gh` CLI (authenticated), `git`, network access, write access to repo |
| Re-run safe | Yes — skips already-PASS items, idempotent |
