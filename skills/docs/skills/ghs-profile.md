# ghs-profile

Display a full 360-degree view of a GitHub user: profile info, repository portfolio, pinned repos, contribution stats, open work, organization memberships, and recent activity.

## When to Use

Use this skill to view a GitHub user's complete profile — your own or someone else's. Defaults to the authenticated user when no username is given.

**Arguments:** `[username]`
**Trigger phrases:** "show my profile", "github profile", "who is {user}", "show @me", "my github stats", "what repos does {user} have", "contribution summary", "profile overview", "360 view"

## What It Does

1. **Resolves** the target user (argument or `@me`) and sets an IS_VIEWER flag
2. **Fetches profile data** — name, bio, company, location, followers, member since
3. **Lists repositories** — top 5 by stars, language breakdown, fork ratio
4. **Shows pinned repos** — up to 6 pinned repositories via GraphQL
5. **Contribution stats** — commits, PRs, issues, reviews for the current year (IS_VIEWER only)
6. **Open work** — authored PRs, assigned issues, review requests (IS_VIEWER only)
7. **Organizations** — public org memberships
8. **Recent activity** — last 10 public events
9. **Suggests next steps** — routes to repo-scan, issue-triage, backlog-board

## IS_VIEWER Flag

When viewing your own profile (`@me`), the skill has access to full data including contribution stats and open work. When viewing another user, those sections display an `[INFO]` note and are skipped — GitHub's API restricts that data to the authenticated user.

| Section | @me | Other user |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Profile info | Full | Full |
| Repositories | Full | Full (public only) |
| Pinned repos | Full | Full |
| Contribution stats | Full | `[INFO]` skipped |
| Open work | Full | `[INFO]` skipped |
| Organizations | Full | Public only |
| Recent activity | Full | Public only |

## Example

```
You: show my profile

| Rate limit hit | `[WARN]` — shows whatever data was already fetched |

## Requirements
