# ghs-action-fix

Fix failing GitHub Actions pipelines directly — detect broken workflows, diagnose from run logs, apply fixes, and create PRs. No prior scan or backlog required.

## What It Does

`ghs-action-fix` detects failing GitHub Actions workflows, reads their run logs, diagnoses root causes, and applies targeted fixes — each in its own worktree with a dedicated PR.

### How It Differs from ghs-backlog-fix

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `ghs-backlog-fix` | Fix pre-existing backlog items from a scan |
| `ghs-action-fix` | **Direct**: "my CI is broken" — detect, diagnose, fix, PR |

### Scope Boundary

**Only modifies** `.github/workflows/` files. If CI fails due to broken application code (test failures, compilation errors), the skill reports `NEEDS_HUMAN` with a diagnosis instead of attempting a fix.

### Process

1. **Detect** — Find failing workflows via `gh run list`
2. **Prepare** — Clone/pull repo, detect tech stack
3. **Confirm** — Show triage table, wait for user confirmation
4. **Worktrees** — One worktree per failing workflow (`fix/action-{slug}`)
5. **Agents** — Spawn parallel CI Fix Agents (one per workflow)
6. **Collect** — Parse results, apply circuit breaker (3 attempts max)
7. **Cleanup** — Remove worktrees for PASS/FAILED; preserve NEEDS_HUMAN
8. **Report** — Show results table with PR links and NEEDS_HUMAN instructions

### Root Cause Classification

Each CI Fix Agent classifies failures before acting:

| Category | Examples | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| WORKFLOW_FIX | Deprecated actions, wrong runtime versions, missing permissions, YAML errors | Fix the workflow file |
| APP_CODE | Test failures, compilation errors, missing imports | NEEDS_HUMAN |
| ENVIRONMENT | Expired secrets, missing repo variables | NEEDS_HUMAN |

## Example

```
## Failing Workflows: phmatray/my-project

| # | Workflow | File     | Last Run | Branch | Run ID |
|---|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | CI       | ci.yml   | failure  | main   | 12345  |
| 2 | Deploy   | deploy.yml | failure | main   | 12346  |

Workflows to fix: 2

Proceed with all? (y/n)
```

After fixing:

```
## Results: phmatray/my-project

| Workflow | File       | Diagnosis             | Status        | PR  |
|----------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----|
| CI       | ci.yml     | Node 16 → 20 upgrade | [PASS]        | #42 |
| Deploy   | deploy.yml | Broken app test       | [NEEDS_HUMAN] | —   |

---

Summary:
  Fixed: 1/2
  PRs created: 1

Needs human attention:
  [NEEDS_HUMAN] Deploy (deploy.yml) — CI fails due to broken test in
    src/auth.test.ts, not a workflow issue
```

## Routes To

After fixing, GHS suggests:

- **[ghs-merge-prs](/skills/ghs-merge-prs)** — to merge the created PRs
- **[ghs-repo-scan](/skills/ghs-repo-scan)** — to run a full health check

## Technical Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Allowed tools | `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(git:*)`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task` |
| Spawns sub-agents | Yes — one CI Fix Agent per failing workflow, parallel execution |
| Phases | 8 (Detect, Prepare, Confirm, Worktrees, Agents, Collect, Cleanup, Report) |
| Circuit breaker | 3 attempts per workflow, then NEEDS_HUMAN |
| Requires | `gh` CLI (authenticated), `git`, network access, write access to repo |
| Re-run safe | Yes — only targets currently failing workflows |
