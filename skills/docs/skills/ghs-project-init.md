## What It Does

`ghs-project-init` creates a new GitHub repository (or scaffolds an existing empty one) with every file and setting that `ghs-repo-scan` checks. It uses the GSD framework for orchestrating the scaffolding pipeline, producing a repo that targets 100% on its first scan.

### Scope Boundary

**Creates new repositories and their initial files.** Does NOT modify existing repos with code, re-scan repos, or implement features.

### GSD Dependency

GSD is a **hard requirement** for this skill. The scaffolding pipeline is inherently multi-phase and benefits from GSD's structured execution, atomic commits, and verification guarantees. If GSD is not installed, the skill fails fast with install instructions.

### Process

1. **Parse input** — Extract repo name, owner, stack/visibility/license hints
2. **Pre-flight** — Check gh auth, GSD installed, repo name available
3. **Gather preferences** — Tech stack, license, visibility, description, topics, code owners
4. **Show plan** — Display all files to create, wait for confirmation
5. **Create repo** — `gh repo create` with clone
6. **GSD scaffolding** — Invoke GSD to generate all files in dependency order
7. **Push & configure** — Push commits, set API settings (description, topics, branch protection, merge strategy, labels)
8. **Verify** — Check all expected files exist and score the result
