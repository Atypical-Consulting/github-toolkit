## What It Does

`ghs-backlog-next` queries all GitHub Project items (via `gh project item-list` and jq pipelines) and returns one recommendation: the single most impactful item you should fix next. It is fast and focused -- no dashboard, no tables, just a clear recommendation with the exact command to apply it.

### Priority Algorithm

The algorithm selects the highest-impact item by applying these rules in order:

1. **Lowest health score percentage repo first** — the repo that needs the most help
2. **Health items over issues** — health items improve the repo's structural foundation
3. **Lowest tier number** — Tier 1 (Required) before Tier 2 (Recommended) before Tier 3 (Nice to Have)
4. **Highest point value** — within the same tier, pick the item worth more points
5. **Oldest issue** — for issues, pick the oldest by creation date
6. **Alphabetical** — final tiebreaker

## Example

```
## Next: LICENSE

Repository:  phmatray/Formidable (22% health)
Source:      Health Check — Tier 1 (Required)
Points:      4
Category:    B (file changes)

Why this item: Lowest-scoring repo, highest-tier failing check.

To apply:
  /ghs-backlog-fix phmatray/Formidable --item license

Runner-up: README for phmatray/NewSLN (67% health, Tier 1, 4 pts)
```

When everything is done:

```
## All caught up!

All health checks are passing and all issues have been addressed.
To re-scan for changes: /ghs-repo-scan phmatray/Formidable
```

## Routes To

After seeing the recommendation, GHS suggests:

- **[ghs-backlog-fix](/skills/ghs-backlog-fix)** — with the exact command to apply the recommended item
- **[ghs-repo-scan](/skills/ghs-repo-scan)** — if everything is done or data is stale
