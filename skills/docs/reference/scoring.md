# Scoring

GHS uses a modular, tiered scoring system to measure repository health.

## Modules

| Module | Checks | Max Points | Weight (with lang module) | Weight (solo) |
|--------|--------|------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Core | 40 scored + 3 INFO | 74 | 60% | 100% |
| .NET | 20 scored + 3 INFO | 34 | 40% | --- |

## Point Values

| Tier | Points | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | 4 | Required --- fundamental quality |
| Tier 2 | 2 | Recommended --- professional standards |
| Tier 3 | 1 | Nice to Have --- polish and completeness |

## Core Module Maximum

| Tier | Checks | Points Each | Subtotal |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | 4 | 4 | 16 |
| Tier 2 | 22 | 2 | 44 |
| Tier 3 | 14 | 1 | 14 |
| **Total** | **40** | | **74** |

## .NET Module Maximum

| Tier | Checks | Points Each | Subtotal |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
| Tier 2 | 8 | 2 | 16 |
| Tier 3 | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| **Total** | **20** | | **34** |

## Calculation

Scores are computed by querying GitHub Project items via `jq` pipelines — no local files or Python scripts are involved. See the [GitHub Projects Format](./backlog-format) reference for the full jq queries.

### Single module (core only)

```
score = earned_points / possible_points x 100
```

### Multiple modules (core + language)

Each module is scored independently, then combined:

```
core_pct = core_earned / core_possible x 100
lang_pct = lang_earned / lang_possible x 100
combined = round(core_pct x 0.6 + lang_pct x 0.4)
```

All percentages rounded to the nearest integer.

## Special Rules

### WARN Exclusion
If a check returns WARN (cannot verify), it is excluded from both earned AND possible totals. This prevents penalizing repos for checks that can't be verified (e.g., permission issues). WARN items are never added to the GitHub Project, so they are automatically excluded from all jq scoring queries.

### INFO Exclusion
INFO checks carry no points and are purely informational:

**Core:** Funding, Discussions Enabled, Commit Signoff

**.NET:** Target Framework, Package Count, Build System

### Module Priority
When recommending next actions, core module items take priority over language module items at the same tier and point value.

## Progress Bar

Scores are visualized with an 8-character progress bar:
```
Score: 52/74 (70%) ██████░░
```

Characters: filled with `█` and empty with `░`. Filled = `round(percentage / 100 x 8)`.

## Score Interpretation

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100% | Excellent --- repo follows best practices |
| 70-89% | Good --- some improvements available |
| 50-69% | Fair --- notable gaps in repo quality |
| Below 50% | Needs attention --- fundamental issues |
