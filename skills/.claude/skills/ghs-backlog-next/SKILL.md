Purpose: Read-only recommendation engine that selects the single highest-impact project item using the priority algorithm.

Roles:
1. **Recommender** (you) — queries GitHub Project items, applies priority algorithm, displays the top recommendation

No sub-agents — this is a lightweight, read-only skill.

## Anti-Patterns

| Do NOT | Do Instead | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Recommend an already-fixed (Done) item | Always check current Status from the project item before recommending | Wastes the user's time on completed work |
| Recommend without verifying item still exists | Confirm the project item is present and status is `Todo` | Item may have been deleted or moved to Done after a fix |
| Show multiple recommendations as a list | Return exactly one item; show a single runner-up line only if multiple repos exist | Defeats the purpose of "next ONE item" — causes decision paralysis |
| Guess the score instead of calculating | Always use the jq pipeline from `projects-format.md` for accurate scores | Produces wrong priority ordering |
| Recommend WARN items as actionable | Skip WARN items (they are never in the project); only mention them if nothing else remains | WARN means permission-blocked; user cannot fix it |
| Recommend items with ACTIVE blockers in the state issue | Read the state issue and exclude blocked/recently-failed/skipped items | Wastes time on items that are known to be unresolvable right now |
| Ignore the state issue when it exists | Always check the state issue before recommending — it has blockers, failures, and skip decisions | Missing context leads to recommending items that will fail again |

</anti-patterns>

## Input

No input required. Discovers all `[GHS]` projects for the owner automatically.

Optional: the user may specify a repo to limit the search — "next for phmatray/Formidable".

| Trigger | Example | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| General next | "what should I work on next?" | Scan all `[GHS]` projects, pick the single best item |
| Repo-scoped next | "next for phmatray/Formidable" | Limit search to `[GHS] phmatray/Formidable` project only |
| After a fix | "next" | Previous fix is now Done, pick the next best item |

## Pre-flight

Verify project scope before any project API call:

```bash
gh auth status 2>&1 | grep -q "project" || echo "[FAIL] Run: gh auth refresh -s project"
```

<required_reading>
- Read all projects via `gh project item-list` for recommendation data
</required_reading>

<process>

## Process

### Phase 1 — Discover Failing Items

Discover all `[GHS]` projects for the owner (or the specified project):

```bash
gh project list --owner {owner} --format json \
  --jq '.projects[] | select(.title | startswith("[GHS]"))'
```

For each project, query all items and filter for health check items in the `Todo` column:

```bash
ITEMS=$(gh project item-list $PROJECT_NUM --owner {owner} --format json --limit 500)

# Health check items that need fixing
FAIL_ITEMS=$(echo "$ITEMS" | jq '[.items[] | select(.source == "Health Check" and .status == "Todo")]')
```

For each failing item, extract:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Repository | From project title (strip `[GHS] ` prefix) |
| Check name | From item title (strip `[Health] ` prefix) |
| Tier | From item `tier` field (`1 — Required`, `2 — Recommended`, `3 — Nice to Have`) |
| Points | From item `points` field (4, 2, or 1) |
| Slug | From item `slug` field |
| Category | From item `category` field |
| Status | `Todo` only; skip `Done` and `In Progress` |

Also look for `GitHub Issue` items in the `Todo` column — issues are secondary to health items:

```bash
OPEN_ISSUES=$(echo "$ITEMS" | jq '[.items[] | select(.source == "GitHub Issue" and .status == "Todo")]')
```

### Phase 1.5 — Filter Using State Issue

For each repo, look up the state issue if it exists:

```bash
gh issue list --repo {owner}/{repo} --label "ghs:state" --state open \
  --json number,title,body --limit 1
```

Use the state issue body to exclude items from the candidate pool:

| State Issue Data | Filter Rule |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Active blockers** | Exclude items listed in the `Affected Items` column of ACTIVE blockers |
| **Last session failures** | Exclude items that FAILED in the most recent session (unless user says "retry") |
| **Decisions with skip** | Exclude items the user explicitly decided to skip |

> **Rule:** State issue filtering happens before the priority algorithm. Only unblocked, non-failed, non-skipped items enter the ranking.
>
> **Trigger:** State issue exists for the repo being evaluated
>
> **Example:** State issue has `branch-protection` as affected by an ACTIVE blocker "No admin access" — skip `[Health] Branch Protection` project item even though it is Tier 1 with 4 points.

If no state issue exists for the repo, skip this phase — all Todo health items are candidates.

### Phase 2 — Select the Highest-Impact Item

Apply the priority algorithm (see `scoring-logic.md` for canonical definition):

| Priority | Rule |
|----------|------|
| 1 | Lowest health score percentage repo first |
| 2 | Health items over issues (structural foundation) |
| 3 | Lowest tier number (Tier 1 before Tier 2 before Tier 3) |
| 4 | Highest point value within same tier |
| 5 | Oldest issue (by creation date) for issue items |
| 6 | Alphabetical (final tiebreaker) |

Calculate per-repo scores using the jq pipeline from `projects-format.md`:

```bash
ITEMS=$(gh project item-list $PROJECT_NUM --owner {owner} --format json --limit 500)
EARNED=$(echo "$ITEMS" | jq '[.items[] | select(.source == "Health Check" and .status == "Done") | .points] | add // 0')
POSSIBLE=$(echo "$ITEMS" | jq '[.items[] | select(.source == "Health Check" and (.status == "Todo" or .status == "Done")) | .points] | add // 0')
SCORE=$(echo "scale=0; $EARNED * 100 / $POSSIBLE" | bc)
```

Alternatively, read the cached score from the `[GHS Score]` item for efficiency:

```bash
SCORE_BODY=$(echo "$ITEMS" | jq -r '.items[] | select(.title == "[GHS Score]") | .body' | jq '.score')
```

Tie between repos with same score: pick the one with the most failing items.

### Phase 3 — Display Recommendation

#### Standard recommendation

```
## Next: {Check Name}

Repository:  {owner}/{repo} ({score}% health)
Source:      Health Check — Tier {N} ({Required|Recommended|Nice to Have})
Points:      {points}
Category:    {A (API-only) | B (file changes) | CI}

Why this item: {one sentence — e.g., "Lowest-scoring repo, highest-tier failing check."}
{If items were filtered by state issue:}
Skipped: {N} items excluded (blocked: {b}, recent failures: {f}, user-skipped: {s})

To apply:
  /ghs-backlog-fix {owner}/{repo} --item {slug}

{If item has a linked GitHub issue:}
GitHub Issue: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}
```

If there are multiple repos, also show the runner-up (one line only):

```
Runner-up: {Check Name} for {owner}/{repo} ({score}% health, Tier {N}, {points} pts)
```

#### All caught up

If all health items are Done and all issues are Done or In Progress:

```
## All caught up!

All health checks are passing and all issues have been addressed.
To re-scan for changes: /ghs-repo-scan {owner}/{repo}
```

</process>

## Good and Bad Examples

### Good: Clear single recommendation

```
## Next: LICENSE

Repository:  phmatray/Formidable (32% health)
Source:      Health Check — Tier 1 (Required)
Points:      4
Category:    B (file changes)

Why this item: Lowest-scoring repo, highest-tier failing check worth 4 points.

To apply:
  /ghs-backlog-fix phmatray/Formidable --item license
```

### Bad: Multiple recommendations dumped as a list

```
Here are the top 5 items you should work on:
1. LICENSE for phmatray/Formidable
2. README for phmatray/Formidable
3. .editorconfig for phmatray/Formidable
4. SECURITY.md for phmatray/Formidable
5. Branch protection for phmatray/Formidable
```

Why it is bad: defeats the purpose of "next ONE item" and creates decision paralysis. Use `ghs-backlog-board` for full lists.

### Bad: Recommending a Done item

```
## Next: README.md

Repository:  phmatray/Formidable (75% health)
Source:      Health Check — Tier 1 (Required)
Points:      4

To apply:
  /ghs-backlog-fix phmatray/Formidable --item readme
```

Why it is bad: README project item has status `Done`. Always verify the item's current Status field before recommending.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No GitHub Projects found | Tell user no scans have been run; suggest `/ghs-repo-scan {owner}/{repo}` |
| All items Done | Display the "All caught up!" message |
| Only WARN items left | Explain remaining items are permission-blocked (not in project); suggest checking access |
| Multiple repos tied on score | Pick the one with the most failing items |
| Stale data (`[GHS Score]` updated > 30 days ago) | Note it and suggest re-scanning: `/ghs-repo-scan {owner}/{repo}` |
| All Todo items blocked by state issue | Show "All remaining items are blocked" with blocker summary; suggest resolving blockers |
| User says "retry" after blocked recommendation | Ignore state issue filters for that item and recommend it anyway |
| No state issue exists | Normal flow — all Todo items are candidates (no filtering) |

## Routing

| After This Skill | Suggest |
|-----------------|---------|
| User wants to apply the fix | `/ghs-backlog-fix {owner}/{repo} --item {slug}` |
| Everything is done | `/ghs-repo-scan {owner}/{repo}` to re-scan for changes |
| User wants a full overview | `/ghs-backlog-board` for the multi-repo dashboard |
