# Issue Triage

Verify a consistent label taxonomy exists on a GitHub repository, then classify and label open issues by type and priority.

Purpose: Ensure consistent issue labeling by establishing a label taxonomy and classifying issues by type and priority.

Roles:
1. **Triage Agent** (you) — creates missing labels, fetches issues, classifies each by type and priority, applies labels after confirmation

This skill does not spawn sub-agents — classification benefits from seeing all issues together for consistent calibration.

Shared references (see `../shared/references/`):

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` | Authentication, repo detection, error handling, idempotent commands |
| `../shared/references/output-conventions.md` | Status indicators, table patterns, summary blocks |
</context>

<anti-patterns>

| Do NOT | Do Instead | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Remove existing valid labels | Only add missing `type:*`, `priority:*`, and `status:triaged` labels; leave custom labels (e.g., `enhancement`, `help wanted`) in place | Removing user-created labels destroys existing workflows |
| Triage closed issues unless asked | Default scope is open issues only; include closed issues only when user explicitly requests | Closed issues are resolved — triaging them adds noise |
| Override manually-set priority labels | In batch-unlabeled mode, skip issues that already have a `priority:*` label; in batch-all mode, propose reclassification but flag it clearly | Respects manual curation by maintainers |
| Create labels that already exist | Always append `2>&1 \|\| true` to `gh label create` commands (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` § Idempotent Commands) | Avoids errors on duplicate creation |
| Treat PRs as issues | Filter out PRs by checking the `pullRequest` field in the JSON response from `gh issue list` | PRs have different workflows and labeling needs |
| Fail hard on a single API error | Continue with remaining operations (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` § Error Handling Conventions) | One failure should not abort the entire triage batch |

</anti-patterns>

<objective>
Classify and label open issues with consistent type, priority, and status labels.

Outputs:
- Label taxonomy created/verified on the repo
- Issues labeled with `type:*`, `priority:*`, and `status:triaged`
- Before/after summary table in terminal

Next routing:
- Suggest `ghs-issue-analyze` for complex issues — "For complex issues, run `/ghs-issue-analyze #{number}` before implementing"
- Suggest `ghs-issue-implement` to start working — "To implement triaged issues: `/ghs-issue-implement all triaged issues`"
</objective>

<required_reading>
Fetch issue metadata via `gh issue view` before labeling.

## Input

Three invocation modes:

- **Single issue**: `triage issue #42` — triages one specific issue
- **Batch (unlabeled)**: `triage all issues` — triages all open issues missing type/priority labels
- **Batch (all open)**: `triage all open issues` — re-triages every open issue

Two confirmation modes:

- **Interactive (default)**: AI proposes labels in a table, user confirms or adjusts before applying
- **Auto mode**: User says `triage all --auto` or `auto-triage` — classifies and applies directly without per-issue confirmation (for large batches where user trusts the classification)

## Label Taxonomy

The skill ensures these labels exist on the repo before triaging. Use `gh label create` to create any missing labels. Append `2>&1 || true` to skip labels that already exist (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` § Idempotent Commands).

### Type Labels

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `type:bug` | `#d73a4a` | Something isn't working |
| `type:feature` | `#0075ca` | New feature or enhancement request |
| `type:docs` | `#0e8a16` | Documentation improvements |
| `type:chore` | `#e4e669` | Maintenance, dependencies, tooling |
| `type:test` | `#bfd4f2` | Test improvements or additions |
| `type:refactor` | `#d4c5f9` | Code refactoring without behavior change |
| `type:hotfix` | `#b60205` | Urgent production fix |

### Priority Labels

| Label | Color | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `priority:critical` | `#b60205` | Must fix immediately | Security vulnerability, data loss, production down |
| `priority:high` | `#d93f0b` | Should fix soon | Major feature broken, many users affected, blocks releases |
| `priority:medium` | `#fbca04` | Fix when possible | Minor bug, improvement, most feature requests |
| `priority:low` | `#0e8a16` | Nice to have | Cosmetic, very low impact, edge-case only |

### Status Labels

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `status:triaged` | `#5319e7` | Classified and ready for analysis/work |
| `status:analyzing` | `#7057ff` | Under analysis (ghs-issue-analyze) |
| `status:in-progress` | `#9b59b6` | Implementation in progress |
| `status:blocked` | `#c5def5` | Blocked by external dependency |

## Phase 1 — Ensure Label Taxonomy

Check which labels already exist on the repo:

```bash
gh label list --repo {owner}/{repo} --json name --jq '.[].name'
```

Create any missing labels from the taxonomy above:

```bash
gh label create "type:bug" --repo {owner}/{repo} \
  --color "d73a4a" --description "Something isn't working" 2>&1 || true
```

Report what was created vs. already existed.

## Phase 2 — Fetch Issues

### Single issue mode

```bash
gh issue view {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,state
```

### Batch mode (unlabeled)

Fetch all open issues that lack both type and priority labels:

```bash
gh issue list --repo {owner}/{repo} --state open --json number,title,body,labels,assignees \
  --limit 100
```

Filter locally: keep issues where no label starts with `type:` or `priority:`.

### Batch mode (all open)

Same fetch, no filtering.

## Phase 3 — Classify Issues

For each issue, analyze the title and body to determine type and priority using the decision tables below. Tables make classification consistent across runs — different phrasing of the same problem should map to the same label.

### Type Classification Rules

Each rule includes a trigger pattern, the resulting label, and a concrete example.

| Rule | Trigger (keywords in title/body) | Label | Example |
|------|----------------------------------|-------|---------|
| R1 | bug, broken, error, crash, doesn't work, regression, fails, exception | `type:bug` | "Login page crashes on submit" → `type:bug` |
| R2 | add, feature, request, enhancement, implement, new, support, enable | `type:feature` | "Add dark mode toggle" → `type:feature` |
| R3 | docs, documentation, README, typo in docs, wiki, guide | `type:docs` | "Update API docs for v2 endpoints" → `type:docs` |
| R4 | dependency, update, upgrade, bump, CI, tooling, renovate, dependabot | `type:chore` | "Bump lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21" → `type:chore` |
| R5 | test, coverage, spec, e2e, unit test | `type:test` | "Add unit tests for auth module" → `type:test` |
| R6 | refactor, cleanup, reorganize, simplify, restructure | `type:refactor` | "Refactor database connection pooling" → `type:refactor` |
| R7 | *(none match)* | `type:feature` | Default — most issues request new behavior |

**Precedence**: When multiple rules match, prefer the more specific rule. If both "bug" and "feature" keywords appear, read the full context to decide. A request to "add error handling" is `type:feature`, not `type:bug`.

### Priority Classification Rules

| Rule | Signal | Label | Example |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| P1 | Security vulnerability, data loss, production outage, auth bypass | `priority:critical` | "SQL injection in search endpoint" → `priority:critical` |
| P2 | Major feature broken, many users affected, blocks release, data corruption risk | `priority:high` | "Payment processing fails for 50% of users" → `priority:high` |
| P3 | Minor bug, improvement, most feature requests, usability issues | `priority:medium` | "Add pagination to results page" → `priority:medium` |
| P4 | Nice-to-have, cosmetic, very low impact, edge-case only | `priority:low` | "Align footer text on mobile landscape" → `priority:low` |

### Good and Bad Classification Examples

These examples clarify boundary cases where the wrong label is commonly assigned.

| Issue Title | GOOD Label | BAD Label | Why |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| "Add error handling for API timeouts" | `type:feature` | `type:bug` | No existing behavior is broken — this adds a new capability |
| "Button color doesn't match design spec" | `type:bug` | `type:feature` | The implementation doesn't match the intended design — it's broken |
| "Upgrade React from 17 to 18" | `type:chore` | `type:feature` | Framework upgrade is maintenance, not a user-facing feature |
| "Refactor auth to support OAuth" | `type:feature` | `type:refactor` | Adds new OAuth capability — refactor is the method, feature is the goal |
| "Remove deprecated API endpoints" | `type:chore` | `type:refactor` | Removing dead code is maintenance, not restructuring |
| "Typo in error message" | `type:bug` | `type:docs` | Error messages are code output, not documentation |
| "Typo in README installation steps" | `type:docs` | `type:bug` | README is documentation, not runtime code |
| "App crashes when uploading 10GB file" | `priority:medium` | `priority:critical` | Edge case with workaround — not production-down |
| "Login fails for all users" | `priority:critical` | `priority:high` | Total auth failure = production outage |

### Confidence Levels

When proposing labels, indicate confidence for each:

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| High | Strong signal from title + body + code context | Apply automatically in `--auto` mode |
| Medium | Reasonable inference but ambiguous signals | Apply in `--auto`, flag for review |
| Low | Insufficient signal, multiple valid options | Skip in `--auto`, propose to user |

## Phase 4 — Propose & Confirm

### Interactive mode (default)

Display a table of proposed labels:

```
## Triage Proposal: {owner}/{repo}

| # | Issue | Current Labels | + Type | + Priority | Rationale |
|---|-------|----------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | #12 Login page crashes | — | type:bug | priority:high | Crash report, user-facing |
| 2 | #15 Add dark mode | enhancement | type:feature | priority:medium | Feature request, non-urgent |
...

{N} issues to triage. Confirm? (y/n/edit)
```

- **y**: Apply all proposed labels
- **n**: Cancel
- **edit**: Let user adjust specific rows (e.g., "change #15 to priority:high")

### Auto mode

Skip the confirmation step — apply labels directly. Print results as they're applied.

## Phase 5 — Apply Labels

For each issue in the confirmed plan:

```bash
gh issue edit {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} \
  --add-label "type:{type},priority:{priority},status:triaged"
```

Handle issues that already have a `type:` or `priority:` label — remove the old one before adding the new one if reclassifying:

```bash
gh issue edit {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --remove-label "type:bug"
gh issue edit {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --add-label "type:feature"
```

## Phase 6 — Output

Display a before/after summary (see `output-conventions.md` § Issue Table, § Summary Block Patterns):

```
## Triage Results: {owner}/{repo}

| # | Issue | Before | After |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | #12 Login page crashes | — | type:bug, priority:high, status:triaged |
| 2 | #15 Add dark mode | enhancement | type:feature, priority:medium, status:triaged |
...

---

Summary:
  Triaged: {n}/{total}
  Types: {n_bug} bugs, {n_feature} features, {n_docs} docs, {n_chore} chores
  Priority: {n_critical} critical, {n_high} high, {n_medium} medium, {n_low} low
```

</process>

## Edge Cases

- **Issue already has type/priority labels**: In batch-unlabeled mode, skip it. In batch-all mode, show current labels and propose reclassification only if the AI disagrees.
- **Closed issues**: Skip by default. Only include if the user explicitly asks.
- **Pull requests in issue list**: `gh issue list` may include PRs — filter them out by checking the `pullRequest` field.
- **Label creation fails**: Some repos restrict label creation to maintainers. Report which labels couldn't be created and continue with existing labels.
- **Very long issue bodies**: Truncate to ~2000 chars for classification (see `output-conventions.md` § Issue Display Limits) — title and first paragraphs are usually sufficient for determining type and priority.
- **No issues to triage**: Report "All open issues are already triaged" and exit cleanly.

## Examples

**Example 1: Triage a single issue**
User says: "triage issue #42"
Result: Fetches issue #42, proposes type + priority labels, user confirms, labels applied, status:triaged added.

**Example 2: Batch triage all unlabeled issues**
User says: "triage all issues"
Result: Fetches open issues, filters to unlabeled, proposes labels for each, user confirms, all labels applied.

**Example 3: Auto-triage**
User says: "auto-triage all issues"
Result: Same as batch but labels applied immediately without confirmation.

**Example 4: Set up labels only**
User says: "set up issue labels on my repo"
Result: Creates the full label taxonomy, reports what was created, done.
