# Release Management

Automate GitHub Release creation: generate a changelog from commits and merged PRs since the last release, determine the version bump, create a Git tag and GitHub Release with structured release notes.

</execution_context>

Purpose: Create GitHub Releases with auto-generated changelogs, semver version detection, and conventional commit classification.

Roles:
1. **Releaser** (you) — detects current version, gathers changes, classifies them, determines version bump, generates changelog, checks CI, creates the release

This skill does not spawn sub-agents — the release workflow is a single sequential pipeline.

Shared references:

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` | Authentication, repo detection, error handling, PR operations |
| `../shared/references/output-conventions.md` | Status indicators, table formats, summary blocks |
</context>

<anti-patterns>

| Do NOT | Do Instead | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Create a release without checking CI status on the default branch | Run pre-flight CI check and warn if failing | Releasing broken code erodes trust and may require a hotfix release |
| Skip changelog generation and use a bare tag | Always generate a grouped changelog from PRs and commits | Empty release notes provide no value to users or contributors |
| Guess the next version number | Derive from conventional commits analysis or use user-provided explicit version | Wrong versions break semver contracts and confuse dependency consumers |
| Create a release on a non-default branch without user confirmation | Detect the target branch and confirm with user if it differs from default | Releasing from feature branches can ship incomplete or experimental work |
| Include unmerged PRs in the changelog | Filter strictly by merged state and merge date after last release | Unmerged PRs are not part of the release and mislead users |
| Skip draft mode for major releases | Default to `--draft` for major version bumps and confirm before publishing | Major releases deserve extra review since they signal breaking changes |
| Create a release when no changes exist since the last one | Warn the user and abort unless `--force` is specified | Empty releases add noise and confuse the version timeline |
| Delete or overwrite existing tags | Warn if the computed tag already exists and ask the user | Overwriting tags breaks anyone who already pulled the previous tag |

</anti-patterns>

## Scope Boundary

This skill **creates tags and releases only** — it never modifies code, merges PRs, deletes branches, or changes repository settings. The sole write actions are:

1. Creating a Git tag via `gh release create` (which tags automatically)
2. Creating a GitHub Release with generated notes

Everything else is read-only investigation.

<objective>
Create a GitHub Release with a structured changelog grouped by change type.

Outputs:
- GitHub Release URL (or dry-run preview in terminal)
- Terminal changelog preview with version summary

Next routing (see `output-conventions.md` @ Routing Suggestions):
- Suggest `ghs-backlog-board` to see updated dashboard — "To review status: `/ghs-backlog-board`"
- If there are open PRs remaining, suggest `ghs-merge-prs` — "To merge remaining PRs: `/ghs-merge-prs {owner}/{repo}`"
</objective>

<required_reading>
Read git tags and merged PRs since last release.
</required_reading>

## Input

- **Explicit version**: `release v2.0.0`, `create release v1.3.0`
- **Bump type**: `patch release`, `minor release`, `major release`
- **Auto-detect**: `create release`, `what would the next release look like`
- **Dry-run**: `prepare release`, `changelog`, `what would the next release look like` — show preview without creating
- **Pre-release**: `pre-release`, `release v1.0.0-beta.1`, `alpha release`
- **Draft**: `draft release` — creates release as draft

### Input Parsing Rules

| Rule | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Explicit version overrides auto-detect | User provides a full semver string | `release v2.0.0` — use v2.0.0 regardless of commit analysis |
| Bump type narrows auto-detect | User specifies major/minor/patch | `patch release` — force patch bump even if commits suggest minor |
| Dry-run by default for informational queries | User asks "what would" or "changelog" or "prepare" | `what would the next release look like` — show preview, do not create |
| Pre-release suffix detection | Version contains `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc` | `release v1.0.0-beta.1` — set `--prerelease` flag |
| Draft flag detection | User says "draft" | `draft release` — set `--draft` flag |
| Repo detection | No explicit repo | Detect from `gh repo view` (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` @ Repo Detection) |

### Dry-Run Mode
When `--dry-run` is present in $ARGUMENTS:
- Calculate next version and generate changelog
- Display the full release notes that would be published
- Do not create any tags, releases, or commits
- Display the dry-run indicator box from ui-brand.md

## Phase 1 — Detect Current Version

Determine the latest released version using multiple sources:

| Source | Command | Fallback |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Latest GitHub release | `gh release list --limit 1 --json tagName,publishedAt` | If empty, try git tags |
| Latest git tag | `git tag --sort=-v:refname \| head -1` | If empty, treat as first release |
| No previous release | N/A | Default to `v0.1.0` or user-specified version |

```bash
# Preferred: GitHub release (includes date for changelog range)
LAST_RELEASE=$(gh release list --repo {owner}/{repo} --limit 1 --json tagName,publishedAt -q '.[0]')

# Fallback: git tag
if [ -z "$LAST_RELEASE" ]; then
  LAST_TAG=$(git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1)
fi
```

Extract the release date for the changelog query range. If using a git tag without a release, use the tag's commit date:

```bash
git log -1 --format=%aI {tag}
```

## Phase 2 — Gather Changes Since Last Release

### Merged PRs

```bash
gh pr list --repo {owner}/{repo} --state merged \
  --search "merged:>={last_release_date}" \
  --json number,title,labels,author,mergedAt \
  --limit 200
```

### Commits (for repos that don't use PRs)

```bash
git log {last_tag}..HEAD --oneline --format="%h %s" --no-merges
```

**Guard rail**: If both lists are empty, warn the user and abort:

```
[WARN] No changes found since {last_tag} ({last_release_date}).
       Nothing to release. Use --force to create an empty release.
```

## Phase 3 — Classify Changes

### Conventional Commits Mapping

| Prefix | Version Bump | Changelog Group |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `feat:` / `feat(scope):` | minor | Features |
| `fix:` / `fix(scope):` | patch | Bug Fixes |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` / `!:` (e.g., `feat!:`) | major | Breaking Changes |
| `docs:` / `docs(scope):` | patch | Documentation |
| `chore(deps):` / `build(deps):` / `deps:` | patch | Dependencies |
| `ci:` / `test:` / `refactor:` / `perf:` / `style:` / `chore:` / `build:` | patch | Other |

### Classification Rules

| Rule | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| PR title takes precedence over individual commits | PR has a conventional prefix in its title | PR #42 "feat: add dark mode" — classified as Features |
| Label-based fallback if no conventional prefix | PR has labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `dependencies` | PR #43 labeled `bug` — classified as Bug Fixes |
| Commits without PRs are classified individually | Commit not associated with any PR | `fix: correct typo` — classified as Bug Fixes |
| Unknown prefix defaults to Other | No recognized prefix or label | `Update README` — classified as Other |
| BREAKING CHANGE in commit body also triggers major | Body contains `BREAKING CHANGE:` | `feat: new API\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: removed v1 endpoints` — major + Breaking Changes |

### Label-to-Group Mapping (Fallback)

| Label | Changelog Group |
|-------|-----------------|
| `bug`, `fix`, `type:bug` | Bug Fixes |
| `enhancement`, `feature`, `type:feature` | Features |
| `dependencies`, `deps`, `renovate`, `dependabot` | Dependencies |
| `documentation`, `docs`, `type:docs` | Documentation |
| `breaking`, `breaking-change` | Breaking Changes |

## Phase 4 — Determine Version Bump

If the user provided an explicit version, use it. Otherwise, compute from classified changes:

| Highest Change Type | Bump | Example |
|--------------------|------|---------|
| Breaking Changes present | major | v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0 |
| Features present (no breaking) | minor | v1.2.3 -> v1.3.0 |
| Only fixes/deps/docs/other | patch | v1.2.3 -> v1.2.4 |

### Pre-release Version Handling

| Current Version | Bump Type | Next Version |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| v1.0.0 | pre-release (alpha) | v1.1.0-alpha.1 (or user-specified) |
| v1.1.0-alpha.1 | pre-release (alpha) | v1.1.0-alpha.2 |
| v1.1.0-alpha.2 | pre-release (beta) | v1.1.0-beta.1 |
| v1.1.0-rc.1 | release | v1.1.0 |

### Guard Rails

| Rule | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Warn if major bump detected | Conventional commits show breaking changes | `[WARN] Breaking changes detected — this will be a MAJOR release (v1.x -> v2.0.0). Proceed?` |
| Warn if tag exists | Computed tag already exists in git | `[WARN] Tag v1.3.0 already exists. Use a different version or --force to overwrite.` |
| Validate semver format | User-provided version doesn't match semver | `[FAIL] "v1.2" is not valid semver. Use format: v{major}.{minor}.{patch}[-prerelease]` |

## Phase 5 — Generate Changelog

Group classified changes into the changelog template:

```markdown
## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes
- {PR title or commit description} by @{author} in #{number}

### Features
- {PR title or commit description} by @{author} in #{number}

### Bug Fixes
- {PR title or commit description} by @{author} in #{number}

### Dependencies
- {PR title or commit description} by @{author} in #{number}

### Documentation
- {PR title or commit description} by @{author} in #{number}

### Other
- {PR title or commit description} by @{author} in #{number}

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{prev_tag}...{next_tag}
```

**Rules:**
- Omit empty sections (if no breaking changes, skip that heading)
- Strip conventional commit prefixes from titles (e.g., `feat: add dark mode` becomes `Add dark mode`)
- Capitalize the first letter of each entry
- For commits without PRs, use the commit hash instead of `#{number}`
- Sort entries within each group by merge date (newest first)

## Phase 6 — Pre-flight Checks

Before creating the release, verify:

| Check | Command | Action on Failure |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| CI status on default branch | `gh run list --repo {owner}/{repo} --branch {default_branch} --limit 1 --json status,conclusion` | Warn user; require `--force` to proceed |
| Target branch is default | `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q '.defaultBranchRef.name'` | Warn and ask for confirmation if different |
| Tag does not already exist | `git tag -l {next_tag}` | Abort and ask user for a different version |
| Authenticated user has write access | `gh repo view --json viewerPermission` | Abort if insufficient permissions |

```
[PASS] CI passing on main (run #456)
[PASS] Targeting default branch: main
[PASS] Tag v1.3.0 does not exist
[PASS] Write access confirmed
```

If CI is failing:

```
[WARN] CI is FAILING on main (run #456 — conclusion: failure)
       Creating a release with failing CI is not recommended.
       Use --force to override, or wait for CI to pass.
```

## Phase 7 — Create Release (or Dry-Run Preview)

### Dry-Run Mode

If dry-run, display the changelog and version summary in the terminal without creating anything:

```
## Dry-Run Release Preview: {owner}/{repo}

  Version:  v1.2.3 -> v1.3.0 (minor bump)
  Tag:      v1.3.0
  Target:   main
  Mode:     dry-run (no release created)

{changelog}

---
Summary:
  Changes:   12 (3 features, 5 fixes, 2 deps, 2 other)
  Authors:   @alice, @bob, @charlie
  Status:    DRY-RUN — no release created

To create this release: `/ghs-release v1.3.0`
```

### Create Mode

```bash
gh release create {next_tag} \
  --repo {owner}/{repo} \
  --title "{next_tag}" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
{changelog}
EOF
)" \
  --target {default_branch} \
  {--draft if draft mode} \
  {--prerelease if pre-release}
```

For major releases, default to `--draft` and inform the user:

```
[INFO] Major release v2.0.0 created as DRAFT.
       Review at: {release_url}
       To publish: gh release edit v2.0.0 --repo {owner}/{repo} --draft=false
```

## Phase 8 — Terminal Output

### Successful Release

```
## Release Created: {owner}/{repo}

  Version:  v1.2.3 -> v1.3.0
  Tag:      v1.3.0
  Target:   main
  Type:     {release | draft | pre-release}
  URL:      https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/tag/{next_tag}

### Changelog

{changelog}

---
Summary:
  Changes:   12 (3 features, 5 fixes, 2 deps, 2 other)
  Authors:   @alice, @bob, @charlie
  PRs:       #40, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48, #49, #50, #51
  Status:    [PASS] Release created
```

### Failed Release

```
## Release Failed: {owner}/{repo}

  Version:  v1.3.0
  Error:    {error message}
  Status:   [FAIL] Release not created

Troubleshooting:
  - Check `gh auth status` for authentication
  - Verify write access to the repository
  - Ensure the tag does not already exist
```

</process>

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **No previous releases** (first release) | Default to v0.1.0; gather all commits on default branch; note "Initial release" in changelog header |
| **Pre-release versions** | Detect `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc` suffixes; increment pre-release counter; set `--prerelease` flag |
| **No changes since last release** | Warn user and abort; suggest checking if PRs were merged to a different branch |
| **Failed CI on default branch** | Warn with run URL; require `--force` or wait for CI to pass |
| **Monorepo** | Note limitation — this skill creates a single release per repo; suggest manual scoping for monorepos |
| **Tag already exists** | Abort with error; suggest using a different version number |
| **Non-default branch target** | Warn and require explicit confirmation before creating |
| **Very large changelog (50+ PRs)** | Group normally but add a count summary; truncate individual entries if the body would exceed 10,000 characters |
| **Archived repository** | Detect via `gh repo view --json isArchived`; abort with warning |
| **No conventional commits** | Fall back to label-based classification; if no labels either, list all as "Other" |

(Missing: author attribution, PR links, grouping by type, full changelog link, capitalization)

### Example 1: Auto-detect Release

User says: `create release`
Result: Detects current version v1.2.3, analyzes commits, determines minor bump (features found), generates grouped changelog, checks CI, creates release v1.3.0, shows terminal summary with URL.

### Example 2: Explicit Version

User says: `release v2.0.0`
Result: Uses v2.0.0 as-is, generates changelog since v1.2.3, warns about major release, creates as draft, shows terminal summary.

### Example 3: Dry-Run Preview

User says: `what would the next release look like`
Result: Detects version, analyzes changes, shows changelog preview in terminal, does NOT create release. Suggests command to create.

### Example 4: Pre-release

User says: `release v1.3.0-beta.1`
Result: Creates pre-release with `--prerelease` flag, generates changelog, shows terminal summary.

### Example 5: No Changes

User says: `create release`
Result: Detects v1.2.3 as current, finds no merged PRs or commits since then, warns user, aborts without creating.
