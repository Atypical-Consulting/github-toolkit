description: >
  Scans a GitHub repository for quality essentials and open issues, produces a scored report, and
  saves all findings as items in a GitHub Project. Use this skill whenever the user wants to
  check repository quality, audit a repo's setup, see open issues organized as backlog, verify best
  practices are followed, or asks about missing files like README, LICENSE, CODEOWNERS, CI/CD, branch
  protection, templates, security policies, .editorconfig, or failing CI workflows. Also trigger when users say things like "scan my repo",
  "is my repo set up properly", "what's missing from my project", "repo audit", "repo scan",
  "repository checklist", "health check", "what issues are open", "organize my issues",
  "save health report", "export audit results", or "create backlog from audit".
  Do NOT use for managing GitHub Actions workflows, reviewing pull requests, creating repositories, or modifying code.

# Repo Scan

Scan a GitHub repository for quality best practices and open issues, display a terminal report, and save all findings as items in a GitHub Project.

## Scope Boundary

This skill ONLY scans and reports. It never modifies the repository, creates PRs, or fixes findings.
Route users to `ghs-backlog-fix` for applying fixes.

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Orchestrator** (you) | Detect repo, detect stack (modules), spawn agents, collect results, compute scores, write project items, display terminal report |
| **Core Health Check Agents** (3x, spawned via Task) | One per tier — run all core checks in the tier, return JSON results |
| **Language Module Agents** (3x per module, spawned via Task) | One per tier per active module — run module checks, return JSON results |
| **Issues Agent** (1x, spawned via Task) | Fetch open issues, return issue summary |

<anti-patterns>

| Do NOT | Do Instead | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Fail hard on API errors (404/403) | Degrade gracefully: 404 = FAIL finding, 403 = WARN with "Unable to check (requires admin access)" | API errors are expected for some checks — crashing loses all progress |
| Re-scan checks that already passed | Load SUMMARY.md first; if user chooses to overwrite, scan all checks fresh | Wastes time and API calls on known-good checks |
| Create duplicate project items for the same finding | Update existing `[Health] LICENSE` item by title-based dedup rather than creating a second item | Duplicates confuse the backlog board and scoring |
| Auto-fix findings during scan | Report `[FAIL] LICENSE -- Not found` and route to `ghs-backlog-fix` | Scan is read-only — fixing is a separate skill's job |
| Skip network-dependent checks if offline | Mark as WARN: `[WARN] CI Workflow Health -- Unable to check (network unavailable)` | Skipping silently hides potential failures |

</anti-patterns>

<objective>
Scan a GitHub repository, produce a scored terminal report, and save all findings as items in a GitHub Project.

Outputs:
- Terminal report with health score, failing checks, and open issues
- Findings saved as items in GitHub Project `[GHS] {owner}/{repo}`
- `[GHS Score]` project item with score breakdown

Next routing:
- To promote findings to real GitHub Issues: `/ghs-backlog-sync {owner}/{repo}`
- Suggest `ghs-backlog-fix` to fix the highest-impact item
- Suggest `ghs-backlog-board` to view the full dashboard
- Suggest `ghs-issue-triage` for unlabeled issues
</objective>

<required_reading>
Verify gh authentication and project scope before scanning.
</required_reading>

<process>

## Prerequisites

**Rule:** Verify `gh` authentication before any API calls.
**Trigger:** Start of every scan.
**Example:** Run `gh auth status`; if it fails, tell the user to run `gh auth login`.

See `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` for authentication and repo detection patterns.

## Input

**Rule:** Accept `owner/repo` explicitly, or detect from git remote.
**Trigger:** User invokes scan without specifying a repo.
**Example:** `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner'` — if neither works, ask the user.

## Phase 1 — Setup and Stack Detection

1. Detect the repository (`owner/repo`) and default branch
2. Detect repo visibility (public/private), fork status, and commit count
3. **Detect tech stack** to determine active modules:
   ```bash
   # Check for .NET
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/ --jq '.[].name' 2>/dev/null | grep -q '\.sln$' && DOTNET_DETECTED=true
   ```
   See `../shared/checks/index.md` for the full module registry and detection markers.
4. Look up or create `[GHS] {owner}/{repo}` project; provision all 9 custom fields (idempotent); cache field IDs. See `../shared/references/projects-format.md` for field definitions and `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` § Project Operations for the lookup-or-create pattern.
5. If project already exists, load `[GHS Score]` item first (progressive disclosure) — only query individual items if needed for comparison

**Rule:** Ask before overwriting existing health items.
**Trigger:** GitHub Project `[GHS] {owner}/{repo}` already exists with items.
**Example:** "Health project exists from 2026-02-20. Overwrite items or skip existing?"

## Phase 2 — Spawn Agents in Parallel

Launch agents simultaneously using the Task tool. Each agent works independently and writes files directly.

### Core Module Agents (always)

| Agent | Template | Substitutions |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Core Tier 1 Agent | `agents/health-check-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{default_branch}`, `{N}=1`, `{module}=core`, `{skills_path}` |
| Core Tier 2 Agent | `agents/health-check-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{default_branch}`, `{N}=2`, `{module}=core`, `{skills_path}` |
| Core Tier 3 Agent | `agents/health-check-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{default_branch}`, `{N}=3`, `{module}=core`, `{skills_path}` |
| Issues Agent | `agents/issues-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{skills_path}` |

### .NET Module Agents (if .sln detected)

| Agent | Template | Substitutions |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| .NET Tier 1 Agent | `agents/health-check-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{default_branch}`, `{N}=1`, `{module}=dotnet`, `{skills_path}` |
| .NET Tier 2 Agent | `agents/health-check-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{default_branch}`, `{N}=2`, `{module}=dotnet`, `{skills_path}` |
| .NET Tier 3 Agent | `agents/health-check-agent.md` | `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{default_branch}`, `{N}=3`, `{module}=dotnet`, `{skills_path}` |

All agents use `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Spawn all agents in a **single message** for parallel execution (4 agents for core-only repos, 7 agents for .NET repos).

Each agent reads its module's index file:
- Core agents: `checks/core/index.md`
- .NET agents: `checks/dotnet/index.md`

Agents return JSON results to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles all project writes after collecting results.

See `../shared/references/agent-spawning.md` for spawning patterns and the agent result contract.

### Context Budget

| Pass to Agent | Omit |
|---------------|------|
| Module index (from checks/{module}/index.md) | Other module indexes |
| Check definitions for the agent's tier | Other check definitions |
| Repo owner/name, default branch | Full SUMMARY.md |
| Tech stack detection result | Previous scan results |
| Scoring logic for the check's tier | Full scoring-logic.md |

## Phase 3 — Collect Results and Compute Score

After all agents complete:

1. Parse JSON results from each health check agent
2. Group check results by module (core, dotnet)
3. Calculate per-module scores using jq (see `../shared/references/projects-format.md` § Scoring via jq):
   ```bash
   CORE_EARNED=$(echo "$RESULTS" | jq '[.[] | select(.module == "core" and .status == "pass") | .points] | add // 0')
   CORE_POSSIBLE=$(echo "$RESULTS" | jq '[.[] | select(.module == "core") | .points] | add // 0')
   CORE_PCT=$(echo "scale=0; $CORE_EARNED * 100 / $CORE_POSSIBLE" | bc)
   ```
4. Calculate combined score per `../shared/references/scoring-logic.md`:
   - Core only: `score = core_pct`
   - Core + .NET: `score = round(core_pct * 0.6 + dotnet_pct * 0.4)`
5. Parse the issues summary from the issues agent

**Rule:** Retry failed agents once before marking as WARN.
**Trigger:** Agent returns malformed JSON or errors out.
**Example:** Re-run with error appended to prompt. If it fails again, mark all checks in that tier as WARN with detail "Agent failed after retry."

## Phase 4 — Write Project Items

For each FAIL or PASS check result, create or update a draft item in the `[GHS] {owner}/{repo}` project:
- Title: `[Health] {Check Name}` (e.g., `[Health] LICENSE`, `[Health] Branch Protection`)
- Status: `Todo` for FAIL, `Done` for PASS
- Body: description of what's missing and how to fix it
- Set all custom fields: Source, Module, Tier, Points, Slug, Category, Detected
- Use title-based dedup: if an item with the same title already exists, update it rather than creating a duplicate

Create or update the `[GHS Score]` draft item:
- Set the `Score` field to the computed health score percentage
- Set the body to the JSON score breakdown (see `../shared/references/projects-format.md` § Score Record)

Add open GitHub issues as linked items via `gh project item-add`:
- Set `Source` field to `GitHub Issue` on each linked item
- Set Status to `Todo` (open) or `Done` (closed)

## Phase 5 — Display Terminal Report

Present combined results as a clean, scannable terminal report. See `../shared/references/output-conventions.md` for full format specification.

If there are more than 20 issues, show the 20 most recent and note: "(+N more — see GitHub Project for full list)".

### Goal-Backward Verification

| Level | Check | Method |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Existence | Output artifact exists | File/PR/API response check |
| Substance | Contains correct content | Diff review, body inspection |
| Wiring | Properly connected | Correct branch target, auto-close refs |

</process>

## Next Routing

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| FAIL items exist | "To promote findings to real GitHub Issues: `/ghs-backlog-sync {owner}/{repo}`" |
| FAIL items exist | "To fix the highest-impact item: `/ghs-backlog-fix {owner}/{repo}`" |
| Any results | "To view the full dashboard: `/ghs-backlog-board`" |
| All checks pass, unlabeled issues | "To triage unlabeled issues: `/ghs-issue-triage {owner}/{repo}`" |

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|---------|
| Private repo | All checks work if user has access. Note in report header. |
| Org-level settings | Branch protection/security alerts may be org-managed. If 403, mention this. |
| Fork | Note in report — forks often inherit upstream settings. |
| Empty/new repo (0 commits) | Add note: "This appears to be a new repository -- focus on Tier 1 items first." |
| No failures and no issues | Display congratulatory message. Create only SUMMARY.md. |
| Many issues (>20) | Cap terminal display at 20, link all to the project. |
| Very long issue bodies | Truncate to 500 characters with link to full issue. |

## Re-running

| Content | Behavior |
|---------|---------|
| Health items | Ask user: overwrite existing project items or skip. Dedup by title (`[Health] {Check Name}`) — update matching items rather than creating duplicates |
| Issue items | Always refresh: remove closed, add new, update changed |

## Finding Description Quality

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Good | "Missing LICENSE file -- no open-source license detected in repository root" |
| Bad | "LICENSE check failed" |
| Good | "Branch protection not enabled on `main` -- direct pushes allowed" |
| Bad | "branch protection FAIL" |

Descriptions must state **what** is wrong and **why** it matters.

## Examples

**Scan a specific repo:** User says "scan phmatray/NewSLN" -- terminal report with health score, failing checks, open issues. Findings saved to GitHub Project `[GHS] phmatray/NewSLN`.

**Scan current repo:** User says "is my repo set up properly?" -- detect from git remote, spawn agents, display report, write project items.

**Re-scan after fixes:** User says "re-scan phmatray/NewSLN" -- refresh health checks (asks about overwrite), sync issues, update `[GHS Score]` item.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| `gh auth status` fails | `gh` CLI not authenticated. Run `gh auth login`. |
| 403 on branch protection | Requires admin access. Check agent reports as WARN -- expected. |
| Rate limiting during scan | See `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md`. Do not retry in a loop. |
| Scan seems slow | 4 agents run in parallel. Large repos with many issues (500+) take longer. |
| `project` scope missing | `gh project` commands fail silently or with 403. Run: `gh auth refresh -s project`. See `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` § Project Operations. |
