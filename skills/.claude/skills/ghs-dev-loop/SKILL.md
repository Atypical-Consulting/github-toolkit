# Full Developer Loop

Act as an autonomous developer for a single repository. Process work in priority-driven cycles: health maintenance, issue triage/analysis/implementation, code review, PR merging, dependency updates, and optional releases. Each cycle enforces human checkpoints for irreversible operations.

Purpose: Replace a human developer for a single repository by orchestrating the full suite of ghs-skills in priority order, operating in budget-constrained cycles with safety checkpoints.

### Roles

1. **Developer** (you) — orchestrates existing skills, manages the priority queue, enforces checkpoints, tracks progress via state issue
2. **Human** (the user) — approves checkpoints, overrides priorities, provides context when needed

This skill **only orchestrates** via the Skill tool — it never directly modifies code, creates branches, or pushes commits. All mutations flow through the chained skills.

<anti-patterns>

| Do NOT | Do Instead | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Process unlimited issues in one cycle | Enforce issue budget (default: 5 per cycle) | Unbounded processing drains API quota, creates PR avalanches, and overwhelms reviewers |
| Skip health maintenance when score is below threshold | Always run health fixes before issue processing | A degraded repo (missing CI, no tests) produces broken implementations |
| Implement without analyzing first | Run `/ghs-issue-analyze` before `/ghs-issue-implement` for every issue | Skipping analysis leads to incomplete implementations, wrong scope, and missed edge cases |
| Merge without reviewing | Run `/ghs-review-pr` before `/ghs-merge-prs` for implementation PRs | Unreviewed code erodes quality and may introduce regressions |
| Release without merging all pending PRs | Merge or defer all open PRs before creating a release | A release with unmerged PRs creates version confusion and partial features |
| Re-process issues that already have open PRs or branches | Check for existing PRs/branches before processing; skip if found | Re-implementing wastes time and creates conflicting PRs |
| Start continuous mode without explicit user consent | Require the user to explicitly say "continuous" or "keep going" | Autonomous loops without consent can drain API quota and create unwanted changes |
| Ignore state issue from a previous session | Read state issue first; offer resume or fresh start | Ignoring previous state re-processes items, re-encounters known blockers, and loses decisions |
| Process issues assigned to other users | Skip issues with assignees (unless assigned to the authenticated user) | Implementing someone else's assigned work causes ownership conflicts |
| Bypass checkpoints even in continuous mode | Always pause at non-disableable checkpoints (High+ implementation, release) | Irreversible operations need human sign-off regardless of automation mode |
| Modify code directly | Delegate all code changes to chained skills via the Skill tool | This skill is an orchestrator — direct code changes bypass verification and review |
| Process all issue types equally | Respect priority queue: critical bugs before features before docs | Equal treatment means a typo fix blocks a production crash |

</anti-patterns>

## Scope Boundary

This skill **orchestrates only** — it never directly modifies code, creates branches, or pushes commits. All mutations flow through existing skills:

| Action | Delegated To |
|--------|-------------|
| Scanning health | `/ghs-repo-scan` |
| Fixing health items | `/ghs-backlog-fix` |
| Triaging issues | `/ghs-issue-triage` |
| Analyzing issues | `/ghs-issue-analyze` |
| Implementing issues | `/ghs-issue-implement` |
| Reviewing PRs | `/ghs-review-pr` |
| Merging PRs | `/ghs-merge-prs` |
| Creating releases | `/ghs-release` |

The sole write actions of ghs-dev-loop itself are:
1. Reading and writing state issue (session tracking)
2. Terminal output (cycle reports)

## Context Budget

What state to carry between cycle stages:

| Carry Forward | Do NOT Carry |
|---------------|-------------|
| Health score (before/after) | Full scan output (re-scan if needed) |
| Issue list with priorities and statuses | Issue body details (re-fetch per skill) |
| PR numbers created this cycle | Subagent prompts and intermediate results |
| Blocker list from state issue | Previous session history (only current blockers matter) |
| Cycle budget counters (issues processed, failures) | Worktree paths (managed by downstream skills) |
| Checkpoint decisions (user approvals) | GSD internal state (managed by GSD) |

## Circuit Breaker

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 3 failed implementations in one cycle | Stop issue processing; report failures; suggest manual review |
| Health scan fails | Skip health maintenance; proceed to issues with a warning |
| Rate limit detected | Pause cycle; report remaining budget; offer resume |
| Skill invocation fails 3 times consecutively | Stop cycle; preserve state issue; report error |

<objective>
Operate as an autonomous developer for one repository, processing work in priority-driven cycles.

Outputs per cycle:
- Cycle report with health delta, issues processed, PRs created/merged
- State issue updated with session entry, decisions, blockers
- Terminal summary with next-cycle recommendation

Next routing:
- After single cycle: "To view dashboard: `/ghs-backlog-board`"
- After continuous run: "All cycles complete. Dashboard: `/ghs-backlog-board`"
</objective>

## Priority Queue

| Priority | Category | Trigger | Action |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| P0 | Health critical | Health score < 50% | `/ghs-repo-scan` + `/ghs-backlog-fix` (all tiers) immediately |
| P1 | Critical bugs | `priority:critical` label | `/ghs-issue-analyze` + `/ghs-issue-implement` |
| P2 | Health maintenance | Health score < 80% | `/ghs-backlog-fix` (Tier 1 + Tier 2 items) |
| P3 | High-priority issues | `priority:high` label | `/ghs-issue-analyze` + `/ghs-issue-implement` |
| P4 | Normal issues | `priority:medium`, `priority:low`, or unlabeled | `/ghs-issue-triage` + `/ghs-issue-analyze` + `/ghs-issue-implement` |
| P5 | Dependencies | Renovate/bot PRs pending | `/ghs-review-pr` + `/ghs-merge-prs --renovate` |
| P6 | Release | Configured threshold met and `--auto-release` flag | `/ghs-release --draft` + checkpoint |

## Cycle Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Budget | Use When |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| `single` | Run one cycle, then stop | 5 issues (default) | Manual invocation, testing |
| `continuous` | Repeat cycles until no work remains | 5 issues per cycle | Batch processing backlog |
| `watch` | Poll for new issues at interval, run cycle when found | 5 issues per poll | Long-running maintenance |

### Rule/Trigger/Example Triples

**Rule:** Default to `single` mode unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
**Trigger:** User says "dev loop on my repo" without specifying a mode.
**Example:** Run one cycle with default budget of 5 issues, report results, stop.

**Rule:** `continuous` mode requires explicit user consent.
**Trigger:** User says "keep going", "continuous mode", or "process everything".
**Example:** Run cycles until the priority queue is empty or budget is exhausted per cycle, pausing at checkpoints.

**Rule:** `watch` mode requires a polling interval.
**Trigger:** User says "watch my repo" or "monitor for new issues".
**Example:** Check for new issues every 5 minutes (configurable), run a cycle when new issues are found.

**Rule:** Budget applies per cycle, not across cycles.
**Trigger:** In continuous mode, each cycle processes up to 5 issues independently.
**Example:** Cycle 1 processes 5 issues, cycle 2 processes 3 remaining issues, cycle 3 finds 0 issues and stops.

## Checkpoint Configuration

| Gate | Default | Can Disable? | Why Default On |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Before health fix | ON | Yes (`--no-checkpoint`) | Fixes create PRs — user should review the plan |
| Before implement (High+) | ON | No | Complex changes need human sign-off |
| Before merge | ON | Yes (`--auto-merge`) | Merging is irreversible |
| Before release | ON | No | Releases are public and versioned |

### Checkpoint Behavior

When a checkpoint is reached:

1. Display a summary of what will happen
2. Ask the user to approve, reject, or modify
3. If rejected: skip the action, record the decision in state issue, continue to next priority
4. If modified: apply the user's adjustments (e.g., "skip issue #15, do the rest")

In `continuous` and `watch` modes, checkpoints still pause execution — they are never auto-approved.

## Input

### Invocation Patterns

| Trigger | Mode | Budget | Flags |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| "dev loop on owner/repo" | single | 5 | — |
| "be my developer for owner/repo" | single | 5 | — |
| "dev loop --continuous owner/repo" | continuous | 5/cycle | — |
| "process all issues on owner/repo" | continuous | 5/cycle | — |
| "maintain this repo --auto-merge" | single | 5 | auto-merge |
| "dev cycle --budget 10 owner/repo" | single | 10 | — |
| "watch my repo every 10m" | watch | 5/poll | interval=10m |
| "dev loop --auto-release owner/repo" | single | 5 | auto-release |

### Flag Reference

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--budget N` | 5 | Max issues to process per cycle |
| `--continuous` | off | Repeat cycles until no work remains |
| `--watch INTERVAL` | off | Poll for new issues at interval |
| `--auto-merge` | off | Skip merge checkpoint (non-High+ PRs only) |
| `--auto-release` | off | Enable release step (still checkpointed) |
| `--no-checkpoint` | off | Disable optional checkpoints (health fix, merge) |
| `--health-threshold N` | 80 | Health score % below which maintenance triggers |
| `--skip-health` | off | Skip health maintenance entirely |
| `--skip-dependencies` | off | Skip Renovate/bot PR merging |

## Phase 1 — Pre-flight

Verify all prerequisites before starting the cycle.

| Check | Command | On Failure |
|-------|---------|------------|
| gh authentication | `gh auth status` | Stop — tell user to run `gh auth login` |
| Repository access | `gh repo view {owner}/{repo} --json name` | Stop — repo not found or no access |
| Write permission | `gh repo view {owner}/{repo} --json viewerPermission` | Stop if read-only — report archived/fork status |
| GSD availability | Check per `../shared/references/gsd-integration.md` § GSD Detection | Warn — High/Very High issues will fail; offer to continue with fast-path only |
| Skill availability | Verify key skills respond | Stop if critical skills are missing |

Detect repository context (per `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` § Repo Context Detection):
- Default branch name
- Tech stack
- Visibility (public/private)
- Fork status
- Dependency manager (Renovate/Dependabot)

## Phase 2 — Load/Create State Issue

Per `../shared/references/state-persistence.md` § Reading State:

```
1. Query gh issue list --label ghs:state (if exists)
2. Extract active blockers → flag blocked items
3. Extract decisions → apply user preferences
4. Extract last session → offer resume or fresh start
5. If no state issue → create fresh (first cycle for this repo)
```

If state issue shows a previous incomplete cycle:
- Display: "Previous cycle on {date} processed {N} items. {M} issues remain. Resume or start fresh?"
- Wait for user decision

## Phase 3 — Priority Assessment

Gather the full picture of available work:

### 3a. Health Score

```bash
# Check if GitHub Project exists and has a score record
# If no project: run /ghs-repo-scan first
# If project exists: query [GHS Score] item from project
```

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 50% | P0 — Critical health. Fix all tiers before any issue work |
| 50%–79% | P2 — Fix Tier 1 + Tier 2 items before normal issues |
| >= 80% | Skip health maintenance this cycle |

### 3b. Issue Inventory

```bash
# Fetch all open issues
gh issue list --repo {owner}/{repo} --state open \
  --json number,title,labels,assignees,createdAt --limit 100
```

Classify each issue:

| Condition | Classification | Priority |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Has `priority:critical` | Critical bug | P1 |
| Has `priority:high` | High-priority | P3 |
| Has `priority:medium` or `priority:low` | Normal | P4 |
| No priority label | Needs triage | P4 (triage first) |
| Has assignee (not self) | Assigned elsewhere | SKIP |
| Has open PR linked | Already in progress | SKIP |
| Has `status:in-progress` | Work in progress | SKIP |

### 3c. Dependency PRs

```bash
# Check for Renovate/bot PRs
gh pr list --repo {owner}/{repo} --state open \
  --json number,title,author,headRefName,statusCheckRollup,mergeable \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.author.login == "renovate[bot]" or .author.login == "dependabot[bot]")]'
```

### 3d. Display Priority Queue

```
## Dev Loop: Priority Queue — {owner}/{repo}

  Health Score: {score}% ({status})
  Open Issues: {total} ({critical} critical, {high} high, {normal} normal, {skip} skipped)
  Bot PRs: {n_bot} pending
  Mode: {single|continuous|watch} (budget: {N} issues/cycle)

### Queue

| Priority | Category | Count | Action |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| P0 | Health critical | — | Score < 50% — full health fix |
| P1 | Critical bugs | {n} | Analyze + implement |
| P2 | Health maintenance | {n} items | Tier 1 + 2 fixes |
| P3 | High-priority issues | {n} | Analyze + implement |
| P4 | Normal issues | {n} | Triage + analyze + implement |
| P5 | Dependencies | {n} | Review + merge bot PRs |
| P6 | Release | — | {enabled/disabled} |

Proceed with cycle? (y/n/adjust)
```

Wait for user confirmation.

## Phase 4 — Health Maintenance (if needed)

Triggered when health score < threshold (default 80%).

### Step 4a: Scan (if no recent scan)

```
/ghs-repo-scan {owner}/{repo}
```

Only if no backlog exists or the last scan is older than 7 days.

### Step 4b: Fix health items

**Checkpoint** (if enabled): Show fix plan, wait for approval.

```
/ghs-backlog-fix {owner}/{repo}
```

For P0 (< 50%): fix all tiers.
For P2 (50%–79%): fix Tier 1 + Tier 2 items only.

### Step 4c: Merge health fix PRs

```
/ghs-merge-prs {owner}/{repo} --own
```

**Checkpoint** (if merge checkpoint enabled): Confirm before merging.

Record health delta: `{before}% -> {after}%`.

## Phase 5 — Issue Processing

Process issues in priority order, up to the cycle budget.

### For each issue (by priority P1 > P3 > P4):

**Step 5a: Triage (if needed)**

If the issue lacks type/priority labels:

```
/ghs-issue-triage {owner}/{repo} #{number}
```

**Step 5b: Analyze**

```
/ghs-issue-analyze #{number}
```

Extract complexity from the analysis result.

**Step 5c: Implement**

**Checkpoint** (non-disableable for High/Very High complexity): Show analysis summary, wait for approval.

```
/ghs-issue-implement #{number}
```

Track the resulting PR number.

**Step 5d: Review**

```
/ghs-review-pr #{pr_number}
```

**Step 5e: Merge (if review passes)**

**Checkpoint** (if merge checkpoint enabled): Confirm before merging.

```
/ghs-merge-prs {owner}/{repo} --pr #{pr_number}
```

### Budget Tracking

```
Issues processed: {n}/{budget}
Implementations failed: {n}/3 (circuit breaker at 3)
```

If circuit breaker triggers (3 failed implementations):
- Stop issue processing
- Report failures with details
- Proceed to Phase 6 (dependencies)

### Smart Skip Rules

| Condition | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Issue has open PR | Skip | Already being worked on |
| Issue has `status:in-progress` label | Skip | Work in progress |
| Issue assigned to another user | Skip | Respect ownership |
| Issue is a pull request | Skip | PRs are reviewed, not implemented |
| Issue is closed | Skip | No work needed |
| Issue blocked in state issue | Skip | Known blocker — report it |
| Issue failed in previous cycle | Skip (unless user retries) | Avoid repeating same failure |

## Phase 6 — Dependency Management

```
/ghs-merge-prs {owner}/{repo} --renovate
```

This handles Renovate and Dependabot PRs. Review is implicit (CI status check).

If `--skip-dependencies` flag is set, skip this phase.

## Phase 7 — Release Decision

Only if `--auto-release` flag is set.

### Release Criteria

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Changes since last release | `gh release list --limit 1` + compare with HEAD |
| All PRs merged or deferred | No open implementation PRs from this cycle |
| Health score acceptable | Score >= 80% |
| No critical bugs open | No `priority:critical` issues |

If criteria met:

```
/ghs-release {owner}/{repo} --draft
```

**Checkpoint** (non-disableable): Show draft release details, wait for approval before publishing.

If not met, report why and skip.

## Phase 8 — Cycle Summary Report

```
## Dev Loop: Cycle #{n} — {owner}/{repo}

### Health
  Score: {before}% -> {after}% ({delta})
  Fixed: {n} items ({breakdown by tier})
  PRs: {list} ({merged|pending})

### Issues Processed ({n}/{budget})

| # | Issue | Action | Result | PR |
|---|-------|--------|--------|----|
| #12 | Login crash | Implement | [PASS] | #49 (merged) |
| #15 | Dark mode | Implement | [PASS] | #50 (pending review) |
| #18 | Refactor auth | Analyze | Deferred (VeryHigh — checkpoint declined) |

### Dependencies
  Merged: {n} Renovate PRs ({list})
  Skipped: {n} (CI failing)

### Release
  {Released v1.2.0 | Skipped — criteria not met | Not configured}

---

Summary:
  Issues: {processed} processed, {merged} merged, {deferred} deferred, {failed} failed
  Health: {delta} improvement
  PRs created: {n}, PRs merged: {n}
  Next: {remaining} issues remaining, score at {score}%
  Circuit breaker: {n}/3 failures

{If continuous mode:}
  Cycle {n} complete. Starting cycle {n+1}...
{If single mode:}
  Cycle complete. To continue: /ghs-dev-loop --continuous {owner}/{repo}
```

## Phase 9 — State Issue Update

Per `../shared/references/state-persistence.md` § Writing State:

```bash
gh issue comment {state_issue_number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### {YYYY-MM-DD} — ghs-dev-loop (cycle #{n}, {mode})

**Issues processed**: {N}/{budget}
**Health delta**: {before}% -> {after}% ({delta})
**Results**: {pass} PASS, {fail} FAILED, {human} NEEDS_HUMAN, {deferred} DEFERRED

| Item | Type | Action | Status | PR | Notes |
|------|------|--------|--------|----|-------|
| #{number} {title} | issue | implement | PASS | #{pr} | merged |
| {slug} | health | fix | PASS | #{pr} | Tier 1 |

**Dependencies merged**: {n} ({list})
**Release**: {version or skipped}
**Circuit breaker**: {n}/3
EOF
)"
```

Record any new blockers or decisions discovered during the cycle.

## Phase 10 — Next Cycle Decision

| Mode | Decision |
|------|----------|
| `single` | Stop. Report summary. Suggest `/ghs-dev-loop --continuous` if work remains |
| `continuous` | If priority queue is empty -> stop. If work remains -> start Phase 3 again |
| `watch` | Sleep for polling interval. On wake: fetch new issues. If found -> start Phase 3. If not -> sleep again |

</process>

## Cognitive Bias Guards

| Bias | Risk | Antidote |
|------|------|----------|
| Automation bias | "All PRs passed review, so they must be correct" | Review is a signal, not a guarantee. Checkpoints exist for human verification |
| Sunk cost | "We already analyzed 4 issues, let's push through #5 even though it's failing" | Respect the circuit breaker. 3 failures means stop |
| Optimism bias | "This High-complexity issue will probably work on fast path" | Trust the complexity routing. High/VeryHigh = GSD path |
| Anchoring | "The health score is 78%, close enough to 80%" | The threshold is the threshold. < 80% means run health maintenance |
| Completion bias | "Just one more issue before stopping" | Budget is the budget. 5 means 5 |
| Availability bias | "The last issue was easy, so the next one will be too" | Each issue is independent. Re-assess complexity every time |

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| No issues to process | Report "inbox zero", skip to dependencies/release phase |
| All issues are High/Very High complexity | Respect budget, checkpoint each, defer overflow to next cycle |
| Repository is archived | Read-only mode — scan and report only, no fixes/PRs/merges |
| Issue assigned to someone else | Skip, respect ownership, report in summary |
| Implementation fails 3 times on same issue | Mark NEEDS_HUMAN, activate circuit breaker, continue with dependencies |
| Rate limiting detected | Pause cycle, report remaining budget, offer resume |
| State issue exists from previous cycle | Offer resume or fresh start before proceeding |
| Watch mode — no new issues found | Sleep and re-poll at configured interval |
| User cancels mid-cycle | State issue captures progress for resume in next session |
| Conflicting PRs from different issues | Warn, do not merge both — suggest resolving conflicts first |
| Health scan already recent (< 7 days) | Skip re-scan, use existing project data |
| No GitHub Project exists | Run `/ghs-repo-scan` first to create initial project |
| GSD not available but High-complexity issue found | Warn, offer fast-path fallback or skip |
| User declines a checkpoint | Record decision in state issue, skip that action, continue cycle |
| All checkpoints declined | Cycle completes with no mutations — report "dry run" |
| Continuous mode with recurring failures | Circuit breaker stops issue processing per cycle; failures reset between cycles |

## Examples

### Example 1: Single cycle with health maintenance

User says: "dev loop on phmatray/Formidable"

Flow:
1. Pre-flight: auth OK, repo accessible, GSD available
2. State issue: previous cycle fixed 3 items, score at 65%
3. Priority: score 65% < 80% -> P2 health maintenance, 4 open issues (1 critical, 3 normal)
4. Health: `/ghs-backlog-fix` fixes 3 Tier 1+2 items -> score 82%
5. Merge fix PRs: `/ghs-merge-prs --own` merges 3 PRs
6. Issues: process critical #12 (analyze -> implement -> review -> merge), then 3 normal issues (budget 4/5)
7. Dependencies: merge 2 Renovate PRs
8. Release: not configured -> skip
9. Report: health +17%, 4 issues processed, 6 PRs merged
10. State issue updated, cycle complete

### Example 2: Continuous mode clearing a backlog

User says: "process all issues on phmatray/Formidable --continuous"

Flow:
- Cycle 1: health at 88% (skip), process 5 issues (3 merged, 1 deferred High, 1 failed), merge 1 Renovate PR
- Cycle 2: process 4 remaining issues (2 merged, 1 deferred VeryHigh, 1 NEEDS_HUMAN), no bot PRs
- Cycle 3: 1 deferred VeryHigh issue -> checkpoint -> user approves -> GSD path -> merged
- Cycle 4: 0 issues remaining -> "inbox zero" -> stop
- Report: 4 cycles, 12 issues processed, 9 merged, 2 deferred, 1 NEEDS_HUMAN

### Example 3: Watch mode

User says: "watch my repo every 10m"

Flow:
- Initial cycle: process existing issues (budget 5)
- Sleep 10 minutes
- Wake: check for new issues -> 2 new issues found
- Cycle 2: triage + analyze + implement 2 issues

- Wake: no new issues -> sleep again
- User sends cancel -> state issue updated, stop

### Example 4: Checkpoint declined

User says: "dev loop on my-org/backend"

Flow:
- Health OK (92%), skip maintenance
- Issue #42 (critical bug): analyze -> implement (Low complexity, no checkpoint) -> review -> merge
- Issue #55 (High complexity): analyze -> checkpoint: "Implement #55? Complexity: High, Effort: L" -> user says "skip for now"
- Record decision in state issue: "#55 deferred by user"
- Continue with remaining budget
- Report includes: "#55 — Deferred (user decision at checkpoint)"
