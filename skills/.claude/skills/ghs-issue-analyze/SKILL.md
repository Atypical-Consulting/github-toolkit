  Deep-analyze a GitHub issue by inspecting the codebase and post a structured analysis comment
  with feasibility, complexity, affected files, suggested approach, and effort estimate. Use this
  skill whenever the user wants to analyze an issue, understand an issue before implementing it,
  get a complexity estimate, or says things like "analyze issue #42", "what would it take to fix
  #42", "assess this issue", "investigate issue #42", "how complex is issue #42", "issue analysis",
  "deep dive on issue #42", or "break down issue #42".
  Do NOT use for triaging/labeling issues (use ghs-issue-triage), implementing issues
  (use ghs-issue-implement), or scanning repo health (use ghs-repo-scan).

# Issue Analysis

Fetch a GitHub issue, clone the repo, search the codebase for relevant files and patterns, then produce a structured analysis posted as a GitHub comment.

</execution_context>

Purpose: Deep-analyze GitHub issues by inspecting the actual codebase, producing actionable analysis that speeds up implementation.

Roles:
1. **Analyst** (you) — fetches the issue, clones the repo, investigates the codebase, produces the analysis, posts the comment

This skill does not spawn sub-agents — the analysis requires accumulated context from file reads that doesn't parallelize well.

Shared references:

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `../shared/references/gh-cli-patterns.md` | Authentication, repo detection, error handling, issue/label operations |
| `../shared/references/output-conventions.md` | Status indicators, table formats, routing suggestions |
| `../shared/references/implementation-workflow.md` | Repository clone/pull logic (§1) |
</context>

<anti-patterns>

| Do NOT | Do Instead | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Implement the fix during analysis | Route to `ghs-issue-implement` for code changes | This skill is analysis-only — code changes belong in `ghs-issue-implement` |
| Guess affected files | Verify by reading code with Grep/Glob/Read | Guessed file lists erode trust; always confirm with actual code inspection |
| Post analysis if issue is already closed | Warn the user and ask before proceeding | Closed issues don't need analysis |
| Duplicate existing analysis comments | Check for `## Issue Analysis` in existing comments before posting a new one | Avoids cluttering the issue with redundant analysis |
| Create branches, PRs, or modify code | Limit writes to posting a comment and updating labels | Scope boundary: analyze only — never touch the codebase |
| Skip codebase investigation | Always clone and read the actual code | An analysis without reading code is just speculation |

</anti-patterns>

## Scope Boundary

This skill **analyzes only** — it never modifies code, creates branches, or creates PRs. The sole write actions are:

1. Posting a GitHub comment on the issue
2. Updating the issue's status label from `status:triaged` to `status:analyzing`

Everything else is read-only investigation.

<objective>
Produce a structured analysis comment on the GitHub issue with feasibility, complexity, affected files, and suggested approach.

Outputs:
- GitHub comment posted on the issue with structured analysis
- Issue label updated to `status:analyzing`
- Terminal display of the same analysis

Next routing (see `output-conventions.md` § Routing Suggestions):
- Suggest `ghs-issue-implement #{number}` to implement — "To implement: `/ghs-issue-implement #{number}`"
- If the issue lacks labels, suggest `ghs-issue-triage` first
- For batch analysis, show a summary table and suggest implementing the simplest issues first
</objective>

<required_reading>
Clone and read repository structure before analysis.
</required_reading>

<process>

## Input

- **Single issue**: `analyze issue #42` or `analyze #42`
- **Multiple issues**: `analyze issues #42, #43, #45` — processes each sequentially
- **By label**: `analyze all triaged issues` — fetches issues with `status:triaged` label

## Phase 1 — Fetch Issue

Retrieve the full issue from GitHub (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` § Issue Operations):

```bash
gh issue view {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} \
  --json number,title,body,labels,comments,assignees,state,createdAt
```

Extract:
- Title and body (the problem description)
- Existing labels (especially `type:*` and `priority:*` from triage)
- Comments (may contain additional context, reproduction steps, or workarounds)

**Guard rails:**
- If the issue is **closed**, warn the user and ask whether to proceed — do not analyze silently
- If the issue is a **pull request**, warn and suggest reviewing the PR diff instead
- If an existing comment starts with `## Issue Analysis`, ask whether to update or add a new one

## Phase 2 — Prepare Repository

Follow `../shared/references/implementation-workflow.md` §1 — clone or pull the repo to `repos/{owner}_{repo}/`.

Detect the default branch and tech stack.

## Phase 3 — Codebase Investigation

Search the codebase for files, functions, and patterns related to the issue:

1. **Keyword extraction**: Pull key terms from the issue title and body (function names, file paths, error messages, component names, API endpoints)
2. **File search**: Use Grep and Glob tools within `repos/{owner}_{repo}/` to locate relevant files
3. **Code reading**: Use the Read tool on the most relevant files to understand the current implementation
4. **Dependency tracing**: If the issue mentions a component, trace its imports/exports to identify the full dependency graph — partial fixes that miss a dependency create new bugs
5. **Test coverage**: Check if existing tests cover the affected area — this informs the risk assessment

Build a map of affected files with line numbers and brief descriptions of what each does.

> **Rule**: Never list a file as "affected" unless you have opened and read it. Guessed file paths destroy credibility.

## Phase 4 — Complexity Assessment

Assess complexity using the criteria table below.

### Complexity Criteria

| Complexity | Files Changed | Cross-Module | Test Changes | External Deps | Typical Pattern |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Low** | 1–2 | No | Minor or none | None | Typo fix, config tweak, copy change |
| **Medium** | 3–5 | Limited | Moderate | None or few | Single-feature addition, focused refactor |
| **High** | 6–10 | Yes | Significant | Some | Cross-cutting feature, API change |
| **Very High** | 10+ | Heavy | Extensive | Many | Architecture change, migration, new subsystem |

### Effort Estimation Scale

| Size | Time Range | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **S** | < 1 hour | Trivial change, minimal testing |
| **M** | 1–4 hours | Focused work, standard testing |
| **L** | 4–8 hours | Significant implementation and testing |
| **XL** | > 8 hours | Multi-session work, extensive testing |

### Rule/Trigger/Example Triples

| Rule | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Single-file text change = Low/S | Issue mentions a typo, wording, or config value | "Fix typo in README badge URL" → Low complexity, S effort |
| New API endpoint = Medium/M or higher | Issue requests a new route, controller, or handler | "Add GET /api/health endpoint" → Medium complexity, M effort |
| Cross-module refactor = High/L | Issue affects shared utilities, types, or interfaces used across modules | "Refactor auth middleware to support OAuth2" → High complexity, L effort |
| Database migration = Very High/XL | Issue requires schema changes, data migration, or ORM model updates | "Split user table into users and profiles" → Very High complexity, XL effort |

### Cognitive Bias Guards

| Bias | Antidote |
|------|----------|
| Anchoring | Don't let the issue title dictate complexity — read the code |
| Confirmation | Search for counter-evidence to your initial assessment |
| Availability | Check actual file imports, not just commonly-known patterns |
| Optimism | Default to one complexity level higher if uncertain |

### Confidence Levels

Include a confidence indicator in the complexity assessment:

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| High | Inspected relevant source files, clear scope, no unknowns |
| Medium | Partial code inspection, some assumptions about impact |
| Low | Limited visibility into affected areas, significant unknowns |

## Phase 5 — Produce Analysis

Generate a structured analysis with these sections:

### Classification Table

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Feasibility** | Feasible / Partially Feasible / Needs Clarification |
| **Complexity** | Low / Medium / High / Very High |
| **Effort** | S (< 1h) / M (1–4h) / L (4–8h) / XL (> 8h) |
| **Risk** | Low / Medium / High |

### Affected Areas

List files/modules that would need changes, with line numbers from actual code reading:

```
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` (L45-82) — form validation logic
- `src/api/auth.ts` (L12-30) — authentication endpoint
- `tests/auth.test.ts` — needs new test cases
```

### Suggested Approach

Numbered steps describing how to implement the fix/feature.

### Risks & Dependencies

Specific risks and external dependencies that could affect implementation.

### Open Questions

Questions that need answers before implementation (if any).

### Good and Bad Analysis Examples

**Good analysis comment** (verified, specific, actionable):

```markdown
## Issue Analysis

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Feasibility** | Feasible |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Effort** | M (1–4h) |
| **Risk** | Low |

### Affected Areas

- `src/auth/login.ts` (L23-45) — password validation uses deprecated bcrypt rounds
- `src/auth/login.test.ts` (L10-30) — existing tests pass but don't cover edge case
- `package.json` — bcrypt dependency needs minor version bump

### Suggested Approach

1. Update bcrypt rounds constant in `src/auth/login.ts:L28` from 8 to 12
2. Add test case for empty password in `src/auth/login.test.ts`
3. Bump bcrypt to ^5.1.0 in package.json

### Risks & Dependencies

- Increasing bcrypt rounds will slow login by ~100ms (acceptable)
- No breaking API changes
```

**Bad analysis comment** (vague, unverified, no line numbers):

```markdown
## Issue Analysis

The login system probably needs some changes. I think the auth files
might be affected. The fix should be straightforward — just update
the relevant code. Risk is low because it seems simple.
```

## Phase 6 — Post GitHub Comment

Post the analysis as a comment on the issue (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` § Issue Operations):

```bash
gh issue comment {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Issue Analysis

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Feasibility** | {feasibility} |
| **Complexity** | {complexity} |
| **Effort** | {effort} |
| **Risk** | {risk} |

EOF
)"
```

## Phase 7 — Update Status Label

If the issue has a `status:triaged` label, update it to `status:analyzing` (see `gh-cli-patterns.md` § Label Operations):

```bash
gh issue edit {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} \
  --remove-label "status:triaged" --add-label "status:analyzing"
```

## Phase 8 — Terminal Output

Show the same analysis in the terminal (see `output-conventions.md` § Table Patterns):

```
## Analysis: #{number} — {title}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feasibility | {feasibility} |
| Complexity | {complexity} |
| Effort | {effort} |
| Risk | {risk} |

```

</process>

## Batch Mode

When analyzing multiple issues:

1. Process each issue sequentially — codebase context accumulates, making later analyses faster
2. After all analyses, show a summary table:

```
## Analysis Summary: {owner}/{repo}

| # | Issue | Complexity | Effort | Risk | Comment |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| #42 | Login crashes | High | L | Medium | Posted |
| #43 | Add dark mode | Medium | M | Low | Posted |
| #45 | Fix typo | Low | S | Low | Posted |
```

## Edge Cases

- **Issue has no body**: Analyze based on title only. Note in the analysis that the issue lacks a description and suggest the author add more context.
- **Issue references external URLs**: Note them but don't fetch external content.
- **Very large codebase**: Focus on files directly referenced in the issue. Limit search depth.
- **Issue already has an analysis comment**: Check for existing comments starting with `## Issue Analysis`. If found, ask the user whether to update (edit comment) or add a new one.
- **Closed issue**: Warn the user and ask whether to proceed.
- **Issue is a pull request**: Warn — PRs have different workflows. Suggest reviewing the PR diff instead.
- **Multiple issues share affected files**: Note overlapping areas in the batch summary — these may conflict if implemented in parallel.

## Examples

**Example 1: Analyze a single issue**
User says: "analyze issue #42"
Result: Fetches issue, clones/pulls repo, investigates codebase, posts structured comment, updates label, shows analysis in terminal.

**Example 2: Analyze all triaged issues**
User says: "analyze all triaged issues"
Result: Fetches issues with `status:triaged`, analyzes each sequentially, posts comments, shows batch summary.

**Example 3: Quick assessment**
User says: "how complex is #42?"
Result: Same as analyze — produces full analysis with complexity rating.
